The easiest way - Raspbian image
################################
In order to avoid driver/setup hell, I created a Raspbian (Stretch Lite) image that has the drivers for the above
hardware, git, fbi, and python3.7, ready to go out of the box you can get the image
`here <https://github.com/kmanc/custom_raspbian_stetch_lite/>`_ or by running
:literal:`sudo git clone https://github.com/kmanc/custom_raspbian_stetch_lite.git`. To use it (I always write my images
on a Windows machine), do the following:

* Open up Win32DiskImager, and write the .img file to your SD card
* Make a blank file on the boot partition called :literal:`ssh` (otherwise you won't be able to remotely administer
  the Pi
* Plug the Pi into power, and an ethernet cable, and SSH in with the default :literal:`pi@<ip_address>`. The default
  password is "raspberry" (no quotes)
.. note:: This is insanely important because I didn't know about this until recently, but if you use my image you MUST
          run :literal:`sudo raspi-config --expand-rootfs` in order to ensure your SD card understands its own size
* First, I would change the default passwords to something else, by running :literal:`sudo passwd root` and
  :literal:`sudo passwd pi`. Please pick good passwords! I use LastPass to store mine just in case I forget
* Run :literal:`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade` to make sure that everything is up-to-date
* Run :literal:`sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces` and make your file look like the following (where <interface> is your
  wireless interface, and <wifi_nickname> is a name that you call your wifi)

::

  auto lo
  iface lo inet loopback

  auto eth0
  allow-hotplug eth0
  iface eth0 inet dhcp

  auto wlan0
  allow-hotplug wlan0
  iface wlan0 inet dhcp
  wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

  iface <CREATE_A_WIFI_NICKNAME> inet dhcp

* Run :literal:`sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf` and make your file look like the following (where
  <wifi_nickname> is the same nickname you put in the interfaces file, <YOUR_WIFIS_SSID> is the name your wifi displays
  to computers, and <YOUR_WIFIS_PASSWORD> is the current password to your wifi - make sure to include the quotes
  this time!)

::

  ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
  update_config=1

  network={
    id_str="<THE_WIFI_NICKNAME_YOU_CREATED>"
    ssid="<YOUR_WIFIS_SSID>"
    psk="<YOUR_WIFIS_PASSWORD>"
    proto=RSN
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
    pairwise=CCMP
  }

.. note:: Up to this point, we have only really done standard Raspberry Pi setup. We wrote the image to disk,
          changed some passwords, ensured the system is up-to-date, and set up wifi configuration files so that
          the Pi will connect to your wifi automatically when it boots on.

The slightly harder way - Raspbian from scratch
###############################################
If you don't like taking for granted that somebody else's Rasbian image is legit, I don't blame you. We'll go through
the steps of recreating the image I made from scratch. Let's dive in:

.. note:: If you are not using the same hardware as me, you might not have to run some of these steps (particularly the
          driver ones)

* Write whichever version of Rasbian you want to use to your SD card. Most likely, you'll want to use a version from
  `the raspberry pi org <https://www.raspberrypi.org/>`_
* Make a blank file called :literal:`ssh` and copy it into the boot partition so that you can remotely administer
  the Pi
* Plug the Pi into power, and an ethernet cable, and SSH in with the default :literal:`pi@<ip_address>`. The default
  password is "raspbian" (no quotes)
* I would then change the default passwords to something else, by running :literal:`sudo passwd root` and
  :literal:`sudo passwd pi`. Please pick good passwords! I use LastPass to store mine just in case I forget
* Run :literal:`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade` to make sure that everything is up-to-date
* Run :literal:`sudo apt-get install libreadline-gplv2-dev libncursesw5-dev libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev tk-dev libgdbm-dev libc6-dev libbz2-dev libffi-dev`
  for a bunch of packages that you'll need for Python 3.7
* Run :literal:`sudo wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/Python-3.7.0.tar.xz` to pull down the Python 3.7.0 release
* Run :literal:`tar xf Python-3.7.0.tar.xz` to unzip it
* Run :literal:`cd Python-3.7.0`
* Run :literal:`sudo ./configure` configures Python (can you see where this is going?)
* Run :literal:`sudo make` makes Python (shocker)
* Run :literal:`sudo make install` uninstalls Python (I think...feel free to check me on that)
* Run :literal:`sudo pip3 install --upgrade pip` because default pip is an old version
* Run :literal:`sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces` and make your file look like the following

::

  auto lo
  iface lo inet loopback

  auto eth0
  allow-hotplug eth0
  iface eth0 inet dhcp

  auto wlan0
  allow-hotplug wlan0
  iface wlan0 inet dhcp
  wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

  iface <CREATE_A_WIFI_NICKNAME> inet dhcp

* Run :literal:`sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf` and make your file look like the following (where
  <wifi_nickname> is the same nickname you put in the interfaces file, <SSID> is the name your wifi displays to
  computers, and <password> is the current password to your wifi - make sure to keep the quotes in this time!)

::

  ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
  update_config=1

  network={
    id_str="<THE_WIFI_NICKNAME_YOU_CREATED>"
    ssid="<YOUR_WIFIS_SSID>"
    psk="<YOUR_WIFIS_PASSWORD>"
    proto=RSN
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
    pairwise=CCMP
  }

.. note:: Up to this point, we have only really done standard Raspberry Pi setup. We wrote the image to disk,
          changed some passwords, ensured the system is up-to-date, and set up wifi configuration files so that
          the Pi will connect to your wifi automatically when it boots on.

* Run :literal:`sudo apt-get install raspberrypi-kernel-headers` because we're about to install wifi dongle drivers
* Run :literal:`sudo apt-get install git` so you can use git
* Run :literal:`sudo git clone https://github.com/kmanc/rtl8812au.git`; I've copied a working version of drivers here
  because I made a config change to the `original ones I found <https://github.com/gnab/rtl8812au>`_ so that they
  work on the Pi out of the gate
* Run :literal:`cd rtl8812au`
* Run :literal:`sudo chmod +x install.sh` so you can actually run the installer script
* Run :literal:`sudo ./install.sh` to install the things
.. note:: If things don't work (because you get an error saying the /lib/modules/<numbers>/build directory doesn't
          exist), you're in for some fun. I fixed this issue by running :literal:`sudo rpi-update` and then copying the
          build directory from an older kernel version into the one that the update command creates. It's gross but...
          it worked
* Run :literal:`sudo nano /boot/config.txt` and add the following to the very end of the file. This lets our Pi
  know what drivers we want to load for our display

::

  dtparam=spi=on
  dtoverlay=ads7846,penirq=25,penirq_pull=2,xohms=150,swapxy=1,xmin=300,ymin=700,xmax=3800,ymax=3400,pmax=255
  dtoverlay=waveshare35a

* Run :literal:`sudo git clone https://github.com/kmanc/waveshare35a.git` to get the drivers for the LCD screen that we
  are using
* Run :literal:`cd waveshare35a`
* Run :literal:`sudo mv waveshare35a-overlay.dtbo /boot/overlays/` to put the driver files in the right place
* Run :literal:`sudo mv LCD-show/ ..` same as above
* Run :literal:`cd ..`
* Run :literal:`sudo rm -rf waveshare35a/` because you don't really need it anymore
* Run :literal:`cd LCD-show/`
* Run :literal:`sudo chmod +x LCD35-show` so you can run it
* Run :literal:`sudo ./LCD35-show` runs the setup
* Run :literal:`sudo apt-get install fbi` so you can use an LCD screen

.. note:: Now we have done a little more than standard setup. We have the drivers and packages needed to use our
          hardware, as well as some software needed for our specific project

Cloning the repo
################
Now that your Pi is set up, it's time to grab my code and set up some project-specific things

* Run :literal:`git clone https://github.com/kmanc/wifi_qr.git` to get the project code
* Run :literal:`cd wifi_qr`, followed by :literal:`chmod +x restart_networking.sh` and :literal:`chmod +x show_qr.sh`
  to make sure that the bash scripts are allowed to run
* Run :literal:`pip install -r requirements.txt` to get the Python module's needed for the scripts to work
* Run :literal:`sudo nano config.ini` and make a file that looks like this

::

  [ROUTER]
  ip = <router_ip_address>
  username = <username_to_log_in_to_router>
  password = <password_to_log_in_to_router>

  [WIFI]
  ssid = <wifi_ssid>
  password_length = <desired_wifi_password_length>

Setting cron and forgetting
###########################
Ok we are almost there! Now we just need to make this thing run on its own

* Run :literal:`sudo crontab -e` and make your setup look something like this - it will be responsible for running
  the code on a regular schedule

::

  # min hour day(of month) mon day(of week) command
  0 2 1 * * /usr/local/bin/python3 /home/pi/wifi_qr/change_pass.py >> /home/pi/cronlogs/change.log 2>&1
  1 2 1 * * /home/pi/wifi_qr/./restart_networking.sh >> /home/pi/cronlogs/network.log 2>&1
  2 2 1 * * /usr/local/bin/python3 /home/pi/wifi_qr/generate_qr.py >> /home/pi/cronlogs/generate.log 2>&1
  3 2 1 * * /home/pi/wifi_qr/./show_qr.sh >> /home/pi/cronlogs/show.log 2>&1

.. note:: The above crontab would make the wifi password update at 2am on the first of each month - feel free to choose
          your own cadence!

And that's it! You're ready to go. You can SSH back into the Pi at any time to change your cron schedule, which might
be a good idea to start because the Pi won't display a QR code representing your password until you do so (or you could
run the scripts manually). Once it's in cron though though, you can pretty much forget about maintenance - everything
should run smoothly on its own.
